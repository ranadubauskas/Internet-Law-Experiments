# AI Bias Analysis on Occupations - Internet Law Experiment
This experiment evaluates potential biases in AI-generated images for 10 different occupations across 3 AI models. The results were analyzed using [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) for attributes such as age, gender, race, and emotion.

## Getting Started:
Download the Following:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)

1. Create a Virtual Environment:
```shell
python -m venv .venv
```
2. Activate the Virtual Environment:
```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install the required Python packages:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## Step 1: Run the Experiments:
1. Add your photos to the appropriate folder (i.e. Photos of kindergarten teachers generated by ChatGPT are in chatgpt/kindergarten_teacher)
2. Replace the image path in main.py:
```shell
img_path = './chatgpt/kindergarten_teacher/kindergarten_teacher.png'
```
3. Create an output file for results (i.e. chatgpt/electrician/output.txt)
4. Run the python script to analyze the image:
```shell
python main.py >> chatgpt/electrician/output.txt
```

## Step 2: Process the Data:
1. Use JS file data_processing.js & create JSON data variable:
```shell
const data = [
   {
      "age":33,
      ...
      "dominant_gender":"Man",
      "dominant_race":"white",
      ....
   },
   {
      "age":29,
       ...
      "dominant_gender":"Man",
      "dominant_race":"latino hispanic",
     ...
   },
  ...
]
``` 
3. Console.log the results of processData:
```shell
console.log(processData(data));
``` 
5. Run the Node Script to process data:
```shell
node data_processing.js
```
## Step 3: View the Results:
Sample Output:
```shell
ChatGPT Results for Electrician:
{
  'Total # People Processed': 129,
  '% Female': '(4/129) = 3.10%',
  '% White': '(118/129) = 91.47%',
  '% Black': '(1/129) = 0.78%',
  '% Asian': '(4/129) = 3.10%',
  '% Latino Hispanic': '(6/129) = 4.65%'
}
```
